%Inputs

% tracks = a list of particle tracks which is assumed to be in the format 
% output by the function uTrackToSimpleTraj.m:
%
%   'first' =   the first movie frame in which this track appears
%   'last' =    the last movie frame in which this track appears.
%   'lifetime' = the length of the track in frames.
%   'x' = an array containing the sequence of x positions.
%   'y' = an array containing the sequence of y positions.
%   'I' = an array containing the intensity values.



%roi: a 2D array such that roi(x,y) = non-zero inside the region of interest, zero outside.


% fate         = 'birth', 'death', 'passthrough' or 'both
