function [ ] = showParticles(in,trks, colorMap,I_max_min, markerSize, labelParticles, textOffset,outputfilename)
%   Draws tracked particles as colored circles onto the original image sequence from which the trajectories 
%   were derived. It is assumed that neither the image sequence, nor the trajectories
%   have been transformed in any way (e.g. rotated and translated).
% 
%   Inputs:  

%       tifname: the pathname of the multiframe tif file (relative to the current working directory) 
%       from which the trajectories were extracted.  

%       trks:  An array of particle trajectories in "simple" format

%       markerSize:  radius of circles in pixels

%       labelParticles:  if 1, add text numbers next to each particle

%       textOffset = [xOffset yOffset] sets offset in pixels from feature
%       center to draw text. 

%       outputfilename:  the name of the outputfile (.avi will be appended)
%
%   Output:
%
%   an uncompressed AVI movie in which particles are drawn as colored circles 
%   over the original data. The color of the circle indicates the status of the trajectory:
%
%      blue = birth
%      yellow = death
%      red = continue
%      green = split
%      magenta = merge
