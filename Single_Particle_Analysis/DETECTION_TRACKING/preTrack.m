function features = preTrack(frms, fl,featureSize, minPeakIntensity, minIntegratedIntensity, haloSize)
% preTrack  A modified version of the Klfoil
% mpretrack function, hiding the unimportant details.
% Note: feature2D requires the Image processing toolbox due to a call to
% imdilate in the localmax subfunction. Use feature2D_nodilate for an
% alternative which works almost as well.
%
% INPUTS :

% frms                 =                    sequence of image frames
%
% fl = [firstFrame lastFrame]               first and last frames
%
% minPeakIntensity          =               the minimum intensity of local peaks to consider in the first step of particle detection
%                                           read from Min intensity setting in Kilfoil Pretrack GUI.
%
% minIntegratedIntensity       =            the minimum integhrated intensity of local peaks to consider in the second step of particle detection
%                                           read from Int intensity setting
%                                           in Kilfoil Pretrack GUI.
%
% featureSize               =           the particle feature sizeto use, read from the Feature Size setting in Kilfoil Pretrack GUI 
%
% haloSize                  =           the width of an annular region around the feature in which to meausure background intensity so as to 
%                                       produce a backgorund subtracted integrated intensity measurement

% OUTPUTS
%
% features - an array of data for each feature detected with the following
% columns:

%   features(:,1)   - X centroid position (in pixels)
%   features(:,2)   - Y centroid position (in pixels)
%   features(:,3)   - Integrated intensity
%   features(:,4)   - background-subtracted integrated intensity
%   features(:,5)   - frame #
